## Welcome to pulecz's GitHub Pages

This repo contains markdown files I want to host somewhere.
GitHub Pages are using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (Ruby based) to process the markdown files to html.

There are many other options, such as [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/) (Python based), which I didn't explored yet.

That's all for now, rest is just what remained from autogenerated pages.

Contents:

* [arch00_install.md](content/arch00_install)
* [test.md](content/test)

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Pulecz/jekkyl/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
