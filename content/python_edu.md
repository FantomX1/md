# Python basics course - The kick-start for learning on your ow

What to expect:

* something as [pyladies](http://pyladies.cz/brno/) to some extent, I can't guarantee we will have time for all "basics" 
* combined with the course the reading of the book [Dive into Python 3](http://www.diveintopython3.net/) ([CZ verze](http://diveintopython3.py.cz/index.html)) should be easy enough
* set you on the path to realize some idea you think could be useful, so you can learn more about the required problematic and cooperate with people who try to do something similar 


Covered topics:

* Interpreter/compiling
* Ipython/Bpython vim-jedi, ideal IDE and workflow for writing/testing
* python3 mainly with explanation about python2 differences and why it will end
* pip, virtualenv vs stuff that is no longer used (so if you google for stuff, you won't get confused easilly)
* what can you do with python, from automating system stuff to multimedia and games to help you choose whatever they want to dig in more
* homework so you work on their weaker skills in their free time
* Bash both on unix and Windows and helpful tools (cat, grep, tmux, watch, ssh...)
* lastly how to make nice CV using LaTex - https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv or using some github rst>pdf whatever template so they are presentable

Requirements:
* free time
* patience
* Ideally Arch Linux installed otherwise any RPM based or Deb based Linux distribution (Fedora Red Hat) or any deb based (Debian, Linux Mint, Ubuntu) or Windows 7+ PC OR any 2006+ laptop with functional USB port to boot flash with Arch Linux from, so even notebooks without HDDs will work. You can try with some Apple product (MAC) but don't expect much support, since I have no experience with those products.
